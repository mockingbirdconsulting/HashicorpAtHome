# Hashicorp at Home

This is the code to accompany the "[Hashicorp At Home](https://www.mockingbirdconsulting.co.uk/blog/2019-01-05-hashicorp-at-home/)" series on our website.

## How to use this repository

1. Clone the repository onto the machine you'll use to deploy the software to the server
2. Install [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com)
3. Use Ansible Galaxy to install the following roles:
  * [Datadog](https://galaxy.ansible.com/DataDog/datadog)
  * [Traefik](https://galaxy.ansible.com/kibatic/traefik)
  * [Docker](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/docker)
  * [Vault](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brianshumate/vault)
  * [Nomad](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brianshumate/nomad)
  * [Consul](https://galaxy.ansible.com/brianshumate/consul)
    - Optionally run `ansible-galaxy install --roles-path ./ansible/roles -r requirements.yml` from the project's root directory.
4. Update `inventory/hosts` and set the target IP Address to the ip address you are using for your server
5. Update `plays/home_server.yml` and set the following4
  * All variables ending in `_domain` must be set to the same value

   This is the domain that you will use to look up services on your network.  It defaults to `consul`

  * `consul_recursors` - The DNS servers you want to use for external lookups, we use the Google ones by default.
  * `nomad_vault_address` - Whilst we set this up, we won't have DNS running, so we need to hard-code the IP Address for the Vault server here.
6. Overwrite `ansible/roles/kibatic.traefik/templates/traefik.toml` based on the details in part 2 of the series
7. Follow the instructions on the blog post to create a Vault token for Nomad
8. Create two encrypted files using Ansible vault in the following locations (replacing the dummy values with the actual text):
  * `inventory/group_vars/all` containing `datadog_api_key: "My DataDog API Key"`
  * `inventory/group_vars/docker_instances` containing `nomad_vault_token: "My Vault Nomad Token"`
9. Execute Ansible against the playbook in `plays`
